	<p>Republican Bill Northey is Iowa's new secretary of agriculture
as of press time, leading with 63 percent against Democratic
candidate Francis Thicke with 37 percent.</p><p>Northey is focused on renewable energy in Iowa and protecting
Iowa's natural resources.</p> 
<p>Iowa is ranked second in the amount of wind power production
among U.S. states, and Northey wants to keep this green movement
going by producing more sustainable energy sources, such as
turbines and stands, and reducing the environmental impact of
farming.</p><p>He recognized that Iowa needs to cut budgets and staff, but he
wants to \"make things more efficient and smarter in order to save
money.\"</p><p>Francis Thicke, a Democrat, also focused on sustainability,
specifically alternative energy and soil retention.</p><p>Thicke said it wasn't an optimal election but is glad his and
Northey's campaigns brought more awareness to sustainable
agriculture.</p><p>\"I didn't win the election, but the dialogue will continue,\"
Thicke said.</p><p>Thicke thinks Iowa is too dependent on fossil fuels and suggests
switching to wind power and biofuel, which he said are better
sources of energy for agriculture than ethanol.</p><p>Conserving Iowa's soil is important since Iowa is losing topsoil
and organic matter 10 times faster than the depleted soil is being
renewed, Thicke said. This could be solved by putting livestock
back on the land.</p><p>Thicke said he will get back to the land after elections.</p><p>\"I'm a farmer and had someone stepping in helping to run the
farm during my campaign, so I'll be farming again,\" Thicke said.
\"I'll be a part of the dialogue about agriculture in the
future.\"</p>
